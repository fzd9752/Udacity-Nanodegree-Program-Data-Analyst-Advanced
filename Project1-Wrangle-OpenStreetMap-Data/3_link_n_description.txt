I used map data from below link:

Map Area: Around Mountain View and Palo Alto, CA, USA
I chose this area because this area is the most active area for the cutting-edge technology. Many companies set their headquarters at there, such as Google and Tesla.

My dream is looking for a job of data analyst at this area, so it could be a good opportunity to explore it for my first step :)
